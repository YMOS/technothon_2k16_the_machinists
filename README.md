# Problem Statement 
To create a smart system that generates genuine feedback based on the parameters of tone and facial expressions

# Motivation
In the previous Technothon event, we saw a lot of ‘friends’ trying to bump up the overall score of a team by injecting falsified feedback. Not only does this give the presenting team an unfair advantage, but it also hampers the overall genuine scope of the project. This motivated us to make an application that generates genuine feedback.
